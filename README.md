# Police Communication Software

This software is designed to help police departments manage their files and communication more efficiently. With features such as file allocation, inter-communication, and geographic location tracking, this software makes it easier for police officers to collaborate on cases, share information, and ultimately solve crimes more effectively.

## Requirements

- Each police station has a predefined position on the map. New stations can be added.
- Inter-communication between stations will be represented graphically, along with distance, based on common files on which they are working.
- For each file, it can be allocated one or several police stations.
- Geographic location of stations will be stored in the database.
- The schedule of the communication between stations (on-line meetings) will be defined for one week.
- The schedule can be reused from one week to another.
- If the communication request is done by the police head, the call is done immediately.
- If the request is done by a police officer, they will receive the date and time when the meeting is scheduled.
- The files in work will be grouped by criminal activity.
- Retrieving a file can be done based on name, file number, or name of police officers allocated.
- For each file, it will be stored the name of agents that make changes (name is stored automatically).
